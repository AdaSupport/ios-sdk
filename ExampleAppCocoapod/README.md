# Ada iOS SDK Cocoapod Example App

1. Using your terminal - make sure you install/update the existing version of the `AdaEmbedFramework` you have installed.
    - If you haven't installed `AdaEmbedFramework` before: just run `pod install` in the `ExampleAppCocoapod` directory.
    - If you have installed `AdaEmbedFramework` before: in the `ExampleAppCocoapod` directory delete the Pods folder, delete Podfile.lock and run `pod install --repo-update`

2. Open the `ios-sdk` directory in xcode

3. Switch to the `ExampleAppCocoapod` in xcode (top middle bar next to the simulator you chose) to run the app and happy testing!
